## Group
My group is called Ecopet.
Our members are:
* Dilpreet Grill
* Thomas Robinson
* Sandeep Kuri
* Foad Makki
* Sing Jobanjot
* Brian Yip
* Daniel Lurvey

   Our plan is to create a mobile application similar to a Tomagachi or virtual pet that is an ocean eco-system. Users input their consumer behaviour and the application shows their effect on the ecosystem multiplied by a certain amount.

   We have a very diverse group. Our academic backgrounds span marketing, computer science and design.

   Having worked together is ideation sessions a couple times now, I find that we work well together.

## Reflection

So far my impression of the sandbox course is the different perspectives brought together within the class. Within my group, there is marketing, computer science and design. When generating ideas in class, Iâ€™ve found that we each have pretty unique perspectives.

At the end of the last class, we added 2 members to our group. One of whom, is Foad, who is also a design student from NSCAD. In our program, Interdisciplinary Design, students generally find an area of design that they have the most focus on. I am curious what we will each bring to the table in our group.
